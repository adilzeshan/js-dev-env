  <h3>The Wonder of Ink</h3>
  <p>
    “And little he knew of the things that ink may do, how it can mark a dead man's thought for the wonder of later years, and
    tell of happenings that are gone clean away, and be a voice for us out of the dark of time, and save many a fragile thing
    from the pounding of heavy ages; or carry to us, over the rolling centuries, even a song from lips long dead on forgotten
    hills.” ― Lord Dunsany, The King of Elfland's Daughter
